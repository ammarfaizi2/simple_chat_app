# There are two address families:
1. IPv4 (32-bit) = AF_INET
2. IPv6 (128-bit) = AF_INET6

# Port 1 - 65535 (2 octets or 16 bits)

# struct sockaddr:
1. struct sockaddr_in (IPv4).
2. struct sockaddr_in6 (IPv6).

# Functions:
1. htons() - host to network short.
2. ntohs() - network to host short.
3. inet_pton() - (presentation to network) string to binary.
4. inet_ntop() - (network to presentation) binary to string.

# Functions for server:
1. socket() - To create socket.
2. bind()   - To bind socket to an address and port.
3. listen() - To listen for incoming connections.
4. accept() - To accept a connection.
5. recv()   - To receive data from a client.
6. send()   - To send data to a client.
7. close()  - To close a socket.

# Functions for client:
1. socket()  - To create socket.
2. connect() - To connect to a server.
3. send()    - To send data to a server.
4. recv()    - To receive data from a server.
5. close()   - To close a socket.
